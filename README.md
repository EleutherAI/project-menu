# project-menu

Eleuther AI's projects are on the [board](https://github.com/EleutherAI/project-menu/projects/1). 

These are for projects that Eleuther developers could work on. **Please do not file issues for questions about how to get GPT-Neo to work on huggingface**. See the [Eleuther AI FAQ](https://www.eleuther.ai/faq/)

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/EleutherAI/project-menu/issues/new?assignees=&labels=seed&template=project.md) if you have an idea for a project, no matter how vague. 

Discuss in [discord](eleuther.ai) and try to keep comments readable for someone who's just coming to the project new, not too in the weeds. 

### The column schema on the board is like so: 

## Seed column

This is where ideas get dumped, no matter how vague, when they're opened as issues

## Scoped column

Once a project has a sense of what deliverables ought to be and how long it ought to take it'll get moved to the `scoped` column. Many projects at this point are seeking someone to take point and advance it to the next stage.

## Shovel-ready

At this point a project may have its own repo with issues of its own, and is seeking people to take down those issues.

## Active

There is an active team executing on this. Use the label `full` if there is no room for more people.

# You should aim to eventually fill the `optional` categories of the issue template, but you don't have to fill them in order to file an issue / propose a project. 

## The tags/labels should be used like so: 

- `full`: does not need more teammembers
- `needs PM`: needs project manager
- `needs engineers`: needs engineers to do tasks
