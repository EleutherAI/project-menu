# Project Menu

A GitHub-based platform to encourage collaboration on research problems.


## Get Involved

Want to get involved? Here's some ideas for how. If none of these strike your fancy, [come chat with us on Discord](https://discord.gg/CZW7s9KS4W).

### Join a Project

There are many ways to get involved with new and ongoing projects. The easiest is to browse [open issues](https://github.com/EleutherAI/project-menu/issues).


#### Replicate a Paper

For many projects, the starting point is replicating an existing paper with minor modifications. Check out the list of requested replications [here](https://github.com/EleutherAI/project-menu/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+Replication)

#### Answer a Request for Plot

A "request for plot," is a way of approaching collaborations on exploratory ideas with minimal friction. The idea is that when one has an idea for a cool experiment, they write up an explanation of what they are thinking and a description of the first plot they'd like to produce investigating the phenomenon. Then someone with more time / the necessary skills / etc. comes and follows the instructions to create the plot, reports back, and you two can discuss the results of the experiment and next steps.

Got a cool idea for an experiment, but not sure where it will lead? A "request for plot," is a way of approaching collaborations on exploratory ideas with minimal friction. The idea is that when you have an idea for a cool experiment, you write up an explanation of what you are thinking and a description of the first plot you'd like to produce investigating the phenomenon. Then someone with more time / the necessary skills / etc. comes and follows the instructions to create the plot, reports back, and you two can discuss the results of the experiment and next steps.

#### [Project Proposals](https://github.com/EleutherAI/project-menu/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=project.md)

Have a research idea fully formed but need assistance executing it? Open a project proposal and tell us what kind of help you need.
