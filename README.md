# Project Menu

A github based platform to encourage collaboration and form links between the one with ideas, and those with the time and resources to experiment. 

## For The Thinkers

1. Ideas are presented as issues. Choose a template suitable for presenting your idea/experiment, and add appropriate tags. Wait for some one to contact you and continue the experiment! 

2. Or just read the through the open ideas and upvote(by reacting with a üëç on the first comment of the ideas you like/experiments you wish you had the results for). 

3. Also feel free to comment for any possible improvments in the existing design of experiments/ideas!

4. Look through the closed ideas for the experiments with results. Upvote the first comment of the prs you deem significant! 

5. Another fun thing to try is to interpret the results given in the many open pull requests. (Comment your observations on the pull requests)

## For The Experimentalists

1. Read through the issues and select one that interests you. After finding one you'd like to contribute to, contact the author of the issue and discuss, understand the idea or experiment in detail. Add the project to the apt place in the [project board](https://github.com/EleutherAI/project-menu/projects/1).

2. After completing the experimentation, open a pull request (feel free to use one of the various templates for reporting experiment results) with a markdown file for experiment documentation and results. 

**Note:** Use ```is:issue is:open sort:reactions-+1-desc```, to sort by the most popular/upvoted issues. Also, feel free to join our [discord](https://discord.gg/mSHDyKSCSX) and discuss over there too.

**Please do not file issues for questions about how to get GPT-Neo to work on huggingface**. See the [Eleuther AI FAQ](https://www.eleuther.ai/faq/)

### The column schema on the board is like so: 

## Seed column

This is where ideas get dumped, no matter how vague, when they're opened as issues

## Scoped column

Once a project has a sense of what deliverables ought to be and how long it ought to take it'll get moved to the `scoped` column. Many projects at this point are seeking someone to take point and advance it to the next stage.

## Shovel-ready

At this point a project may have its own repo with issues of its own, and is seeking people to take down those issues.

## Active

There is an active team executing on this. Use the label `full` if there is no room for more people.

## The tags/labels should be used like so: 

- `full`: does not need more teammembers
- `needs PM`: needs project manager
- `needs engineers`: needs engineers to do tasks
